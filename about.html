<div class="about_content floating">
 Dhishna has its origin from Xplendor, the annual tech-fest of SOE, CUSAT held in 2010. From technical workshops to techniques, from hackathons to musical nights, Xplendor touched all spheres of a student’s life. Although the first of its kind, it opened gateways for students to showcase their technical skills and talents
</div>
<div class="about_content floating">
 In the very first year of its inception, it attracted over 3000 students from over 30 colleges in India with students sharing prizes of over 2 lakhs! In its sophomore year, Xplendor was revamped and given the new name DHISHNA – an intellect so pure and undiluted that it moulds a budding generation
to be better thinkers and achievers.
