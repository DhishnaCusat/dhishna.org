</div>
<div class="about_content floating">
 A myriad of events, mind boggling games, a cornucopia of challenges and competitions, exciting prizes and above all, an
adventure that shouldn’t be missed! The 7 specialized branches of SOE, CUSAT merge together their talents, resources and hard work, the building blocks for Dhishna.
</div>

<div class="about_content floating">
 Dhishna has its origin from Xplendor, the annual tech-fest of SOE, CUSAT held in 2010. From technical workshops to techniques, from hackathons to musical nights, Xplendor touched all spheres of a student’s life. Although the first of its kind, it opened gateways for students to showcase their technical skills and talents
</div>
<div class="about_content floating">
 In the very first year of its inception, it attracted over 3000 students from over 30 colleges in India with students sharing prizes of over 2 lakhs! In its sophomore year, Xplendor was revamped and given the new name DHISHNA – an intellect so pure and undiluted that it moulds a budding generation
to be better thinkers and achievers.
